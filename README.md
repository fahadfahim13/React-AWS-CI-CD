# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions and AWS EC2

This document outlines the CI/CD process implemented for our project using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to AWS EC2.

## Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline automates the process of testing, building, and deploying our application to AWS EC2 instances whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of our GitHub repository.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

We use a GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to orchestrate our CI/CD process.

### Workflow Triggers

The workflow is triggered on:
- Push events to the `main` branch
- Pull request events targeting the `main` branch

### Workflow Steps

1. **Checkout**: The workflow checks out the latest code from the repository.

2. **Set up environment**: It sets up the necessary environment (e.g., Node.js, Python) for our application.

3. **Install dependencies**: All required dependencies are installed.

4. **Run tests**: Automated tests are executed to ensure code quality.

5. **Build application**: The application is built and prepared for deployment.

6. **Deploy to AWS EC2**: If all previous steps succeed and the event is a push to `main`, the application is deployed to AWS EC2.

## AWS EC2 Configuration

### Instance Setup

- We use Amazon Linux 2 AMI for our EC2 instances.
- Instances are launched in a VPC with appropriate security groups.
- An IAM role is attached to the EC2 instance with necessary permissions.

### Deployment Process

1. **SSH Access**: GitHub Actions uses SSH to connect to the EC2 instance.
2. **Code Transfer**: The built application is transferred to the EC2 instance.
3. **Application Update**: The running application on EC2 is updated with the new code.
4. **Restart Services**: Necessary services are restarted to apply changes.

## Security Considerations

- SSH keys are stored as GitHub Secrets and are never exposed in logs.
- AWS credentials are managed securely using GitHub Secrets.
- All sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) are stored as environment variables.

## Monitoring and Logging

- AWS CloudWatch is used to monitor EC2 instances and collect logs.
- GitHub Actions logs are retained for troubleshooting deployment issues.

## Rollback Procedure

In case of a failed deployment:
1. The previous working version is automatically restored.
2. An alert is sent to the development team.
3. Logs are analyzed to identify and fix the issue.

## Continuous Improvement

We regularly review and optimize our CI/CD pipeline to:
- Reduce deployment time
- Enhance security measures
- Improve test coverage
- Optimize resource usage on AWS

By implementing this CI/CD pipeline, we ensure rapid, reliable, and consistent deployments of our application to AWS EC2, significantly reducing manual intervention and potential human errors in the deployment process.
